# MetaDND
Meta D&amp;D will allow the user to experience the fun of D&amp;D without the hassle of bringing paper character sheets covered in eraser marks and smudges. The application will have a custom/random character generator that has all character specifications without the need of the D&amp;D handbook, handbook references for all important aspects of gameplay, a custom/random dungeon generator, and a multi-dice roller.
