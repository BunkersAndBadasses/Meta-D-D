<SKILLS>
	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			APPRAISE (INT)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual value.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			No. You cannot try again on the same object, regardless of success.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			A dwarf gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items because dwarves are familiar with valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of stone or metal).
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 ranks in any Craft skill, you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill.
		</SYNERGY>
		<UNTRAINED>
			For common items, failure on an untrained check means no estimate. For rare items, success means an estimate of 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%).
		</UNTRAINED>
	</SKILL>
	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			BALANCE (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can't move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			None. A Balance check doesn't require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.
		</ACTION>
		<SPECIAL>
			If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.
		</SYNERGY>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Being Attacked while Balancing: You are considered flat-footed while balancing, since you can't move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you aren't considered flat-footed while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing.

			Accelerated Movement: You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a –5 penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof ) that you charge.
		</DESCRIPTION>

	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			BLUFF (CHA)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			A Bluff check is opposed by the target's Sense Motive check. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target's Sense Motive check for each one.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn't take an action; it is part of normal communication.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per round.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand checks, as well as on Disguise checks made when you know you're being observed and you try to act in character.
		</SYNERGY>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it's important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn't believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn't so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.

			Feinting in Combat: You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can't dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target's Sense Motive check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers.

			Creating a Diversion to Hide: You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

			Delivering a Secret Message: You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can't get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see Sense Motive).
		</DESCRIPTION>
	</SKILL>
	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			CLIMB (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Climbing is part of movement, so it's generally part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn't take an action.
		</ACTION>
		<SPECIAL>
			You can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.
		</SYNERGY>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Accelerated Climbing: You try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a –5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed).

			Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds: You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.

			Catching Yourself When Falling: It's practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 20) to do so. It's much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope's DC + 10).

			Catching a Falling Character While Climbing: If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character's fall but don't lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character's fall and begin falling as well.
		</DESCRIPTION>
	</SKILL>
	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			CONCENTRATION (CON)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity. In general, if an action wouldn't normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			None. Making a Concentration check doesn't take an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively).
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Yes, though a success doesn't cancel the effect of a previous failure, such as the loss of a spell you were casting or the disruption of a spell you were concentrating on.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			You can use Concentration to cast a spell, use a spell-like ability, or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid attacks of opportunity altogether. This doesn't apply to other actions that might provoke attacks of opportunity.
		</SPECIAL>
	</SKILL>
	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			CRAFT (INT)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft's daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Does not apply. Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			A dwarf has a +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal, because dwarves are especially capable with stonework and metalwork.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 ranks in a Craft skill, you get a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill.
		</SYNERGY>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Progress by the Day: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result × DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.

			Creating Masterwork Items: You can make a masterwork item—a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.

			Repairing Items: Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item's price. 
		</DESCRIPTION>
	</SKILL>
	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			DECIPHER SCRIPT (INT; TRAINED ONLY)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			You can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Deciphering the equivalent of a single page of script takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			No.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Decipher Script checks.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks involving scrolls.
		</SYNERGY>
	</SKILL>
	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			DIPLOMACY (CHA)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			You can change the attitudes of others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check; see the Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, for basic DCs. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when two advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a third party.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Changing others' attitudes with Diplomacy generally takes at least 1 full minute (10 consecutive full-round actions). In some situations, this time requirement may greatly increase. A rushed Diplomacy check can be made as a full-round action, but you take a –10 penalty on the check.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial Diplomacy check succeeds, the other character can be persuaded only so far, and a retry may do more harm than good. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to his position, and a retry is futile.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, Knowledge (nobility and royalty), or Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.
		</SYNERGY>
	</SKILL>
	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			DISABLE DEVICE (INT; TRAINED ONLY)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			The Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don't necessarily know whether you've succeeded.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. An intricate or complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Varies. You can retry if you have missed the check by 4 or less, though you must be aware that you have failed in order to try again.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			If you have the Nimble Fingers feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disable Device checks.
		</SPECIAL>
		<RESTRICTION>
			Rogues (and other characters with the trapfinding class feature) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create it.
		</RESTRICTION>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Ranged Attack Traps: Once a trap's location is known, the obvious way to ruin it is to smash the mechanism—assuming the mechanism can be accessed. Failing that, it's possible to plug up the holes from which the projectiles emerge. Doing this prevents the trap from firing unless its ammunition does enough damage to break through the plugs.

			Melee Attack Traps: These devices can be thwarted by smashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons, as noted above. Alternatively, if a character studies the trap as it triggers, he might be able to time his dodges just right to avoid damage. A character who is doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes off gains a +4 dodge bonus against its attacks if it is triggered again within the next minute.

			Pits: Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the trapdoor, making it an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building a makeshift bridge across it is an application of manual labor, not the Disable Device skill. Characters could neutralize any spikes at the bottom of a pit by attacking them—they break just as daggers do.

			Magic Traps: Dispel magic helps here. Someone who succeeds on a caster level check against the level of the trap's creator suppresses the trap for 1d4 rounds. This works only with a targeted dispel magic, not the area version (see the spell description).
		</DESCRIPTION>
	</SKILL>
	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			DISGUISE (CHA)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others' Spot check results. If you don't draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Spot checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Spot checks.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Creating a disguise requires 1d3×10 minutes of work.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Yes. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted, they'll be more suspicious.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			Magic that alters your form, such as alter self, disguise self, polymorph, or shapechange, grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks (see the individual spell descriptions). You must succeed on a Disguise check with a +10 bonus to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual using the veil spell. Divination magic that allows people to see through illusions (such as true seeing) does not penetrate a mundane disguise, but it can negate the magical component of a magically enhanced one.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Disguise checks when you know that you're being observed and you try to act in character.
		</SYNERGY>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			2Per step of difference between your actual age category and your disguised age category. The steps are: young (younger than adulthood), adulthood, middle age, old, and venerable.
		</DESCRIPTION>

	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			ESCAPE ARTIST (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			The table below gives the DCs to escape various forms of restraints.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Making an Escape Artist check to escape from rope bindings, manacles, or other restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute of work. Escaping from a net or an animate rope, command plants, control plants, or entangle spell is a full-round action. Escaping from a grapple or pin is a standard action. Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on how long the space is.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Varies. You can make another check after a failed check if you're squeezing your way through a tight space, making multiple checks. If the situation permits, you can make additional checks, or even take 20, as long as you're not being actively opposed.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks to bind someone.
		</SYNERGY>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Ropes: Your Escape Artist check is opposed by the binder's Use Rope check. Since it's easier to tie someone up than to escape from being tied up, the binder gets a +10 bonus on his or her check.

			Manacles and Masterwork Manacles: The DC for manacles is set by their construction.

			Tight Space: The DC noted on the table is for getting through a space where your head fits but your shoulders don't. If the space is long you may need to make multiple checks. You can't get through a space that your head does not fit through.

			Grappler: You can make an Escape Artist check opposed by your enemy's grapple check to get out of a grapple or out of a pinned condition (so that you're only grappling).
		</DESCRIPTION>
	</SKILL>
	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			FORGERY (INT)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged, enough light or sufficient visual acuity to see the details of what you're writing, wax for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a government decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person's handwriting is needed.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Forging a very short and simple document takes about 1 minute. A longer or more complex document takes 1d4 minutes per page.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Usually, no. A retry is never possible after a particular reader detects a particular forgery. But the document created by the forger might still fool someone else. The result of a Forgery check for a particular document must be used for every instance of a different reader examining the document. No reader can attempt to detect a particular forgery more than once; if that one opposed check goes in favor of the forger, then the reader can't try using his own skill again, even if he's suspicious about the document.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			If you have the Deceitful feat, you get a +2 bonus on Forgery checks.
		</SPECIAL>
		<RESTRICTION>
			Forgery is language-dependent; thus, to forge documents and detect forgeries, you must be able to read and write the language in question. A barbarian can't learn the Forgery skill unless he has learned to read and write.
		</RESTRICTION>

	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			GATHER INFORMATION (CHA)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			An evening's time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends, and a DC 10 Gather Information check get you a general idea of a city's major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			A typical Gather Information check takes 1d4+1 hours.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Yes, but it takes time for each check. Furthermore, you may draw attention to yourself if you repeatedly pursue a certain type of information.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Gather Information checks.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.

	<SKILL>
		<NAME>
			HANDLE ANIMAL (CHA; TRAINED ONLY)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			The DC depends on what you are trying to do.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Varies. Handling an animal is a move action, while pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Yes, except for rearing an animal.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			You can use this skill on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks and wild empathy checks.
		</SYNERGY>
		<UNTRAINED>
			If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can't teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks in Handle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and push her animal companion, but she can't teach, rear, or train other nondomestic animals.
		</UNTRAINED>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Handle an Animal: This task involves commanding an animal to perform a task or trick that it knows. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.

			"Push" an Animal: To push an animal means to get it to perform a task or trick that it doesn't know but is physically capable of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.

			Teach an Animal a Trick: You can teach an animal a specific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following.

			Train an Animal for a Purpose: Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal's purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.

			Rear a Wild Animal: To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once.

		<NAME>
			HEAL (WIS)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			The DC and effect depend on the task you attempt.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell takes 10 minutes of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Varies. Generally speaking, you can't try a Heal check again without proof of the original check's failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			A character with the Self-Sufficient feat gets a +2 bonus on Heal checks.
		</SPECIAL>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			First Aid: You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them.

			Long-Term Care: Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.

			Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones: A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.

			Treat Poison: To treat poison means to tend a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.

			Treat Disease: To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.

		<NAME>
			HIDE (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone who might see you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your normal speed, you take a –5 penalty. It's practically impossible (–20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as part of movement, so it doesn't take a separate action. However, hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.
		</ACTION>
		<SPECIAL>
			If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if you're moving.
		</SPECIAL>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large –4, Huge –8, Gargantuan –12, Colossal –16.

			Sniping: If you've already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack, then immediately hide again. You take a –20 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot.

			Creating a Diversion to Hide: You can use Bluff to help you hide. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.

Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target's modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus [if any] + target's modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target's check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and for 1d6×10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target's default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile).
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Varies. Changing another's behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard action.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn't help. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is futile.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are larger than your target. Conversely, you take a –4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are smaller than your target.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.
		</SYNERGY>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Demoralize Opponent: You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent's resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed by the target's modified level check (see above). If you win, the target becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken character takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see you.

			JUMP (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below).
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			None. A Jump check is included in your movement, so it is part of a move action. If you run out of movement mid-jump, your next action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on your next turn) must be a move action to complete the jump.
		</ACTION>
		<SPECIAL>
			Effects that increase your movement also increase your jumping distance, since your check is modified by your speed.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.
		</SYNERGY>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Long Jump: A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).

			High Jump: A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high above or to grasp something overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared.

			Hop Up: You can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.

			Jumping Down: If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.

		<CHECK>
			Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge check doesn't take an action—you simply know the answer or you don't.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn't let you know something that you never learned in the first place.
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.

		<CHECK>
			Your Listen check is either made against a DC that reflects how quiet the noise is that you might hear, or it is opposed by your target's Move Silently check.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Varies. Every time you have a chance to hear something in a reactive manner (such as when someone makes a noise or you move into a new area), you can make a Listen check without using an action. Trying to hear something you failed to hear previously is a move action.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Yes. You can try to hear something that you failed to hear previously with no penalty.

			Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your full speed, you take a –5 penalty. It's practically impossible (–20 penalty) to move silently while running or charging.
		</CHECK>

			Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening's work to a full day's performance. The bard's special Perform-based abilities are described in that class's description.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don't negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)
		</TRYAGAIN>
		<SPECIAL>
			A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or his fascinate ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire competence, 9 ranks to use his suggestion ability, 12 ranks to inspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his song of freedom ability, 18 ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his mass suggestion ability.

		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Not applicable. A single check generally represents a week of work.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn an income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a week to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.

			RIDE (DEX)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			Typical riding actions don't require checks. You can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount from a mount without a problem.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Varies. Mounting or dismounting normally is a move action. Other checks are a move action, a free action, or no action at all, as noted above.
		</ACTION>
		<SPECIAL>
			If you are riding bareback, you take a –5 penalty on Ride checks.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.
		</SYNERGY>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Guide with Knees: You can react instantly to guide your mount with your knees so that you can use both hands in combat. Make your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this round because you need to use the other to control your mount.

			Stay in Saddle: You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take damage. This usage does not take an action.

			Fight with Warhorse: If you direct your war-trained mount to attack in battle, you can still make your own attack or attacks normally. This usage is a free action.

			Cover: You can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can't attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check, you don't get the cover benefit. This usage does not take an action.

			Soft Fall: You can react instantly to try to take no damage when you fall off a mount—when it is killed or when it falls, for example. If you fail your Ride check, you take 1d6 points of falling damage. This usage does not take an action.

			Leap: You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. Use your Ride modifier or the mount's Jump modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an action, but is part of the mount's movement.

			Spur Mount: You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move action. A successful Ride check increases the mount's speed by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You can use this ability every round, but each consecutive round of additional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount as the previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).

			Control Mount in Battle: As a move action, you can attempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.

			Fast Mount or Dismount: You can attempt to mount or dismount from a mount of up to one size category larger than yourself as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. You can't use fast mount or dismount on a mount more than one size category larger than yourself.

		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Trying to gain information with Sense Motive generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the people around you.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each Bluff check made against you.

		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.
		</SYNERGY>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Hunch: This use of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the social situation. You can get the feeling from another's behavior that something is wrong, such as when you're talking to an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy.

			Sense Enchantment: You can tell that someone's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a mind-affecting effect), even if that person isn't aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see dominate person), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target's activities.

			Discern Secret Message: You may use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill. In this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of the character transmitting the message. For each piece of information relating to the message that you are missing, you take a –2 penalty on your Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden is being communicated, but you can't learn anything specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you infer some false information.

			Any Sleight of Hand check normally is a standard action. However, you may perform a Sleight of Hand check as a free action by taking a –20 penalty on the check.

			SPOT (WIS)
		</NAME>
		<CHECK>
			The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot check is opposed by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn't intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary to notice it.
		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot something in a reactive manner you can make a Spot check without using an action. Trying to spot something you failed to see previously is a move action. To read lips, you must concentrate for a full minute before making a Spot check, and you can't perform any other action (other than moving at up to half speed) during this minute.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Yes. You can try to spot something that you failed to see previously at no penalty. You can attempt to read lips once per minute.

		<DESCRIPTION>
			Read Lips: To understand what someone is saying by reading lips, you must be within 30 feet of the speaker, be able to see him or her speak, and understand the speaker's language.

			Varies. A single Survival check may represent activity over the course of hours or a full day. A Survival check made to find tracks is at least a full-round action, and it may take even longer.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the Fortitude save bonus noted in the table above, you make a Survival check once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until the next check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation calls for one. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of searching.

If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.

		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			Not applicable. Tumbling is part of movement, so a Tumble check is part of a move action.

		<TRYAGAIN>
			Usually no. An audience, once it has judged a tumbler as an uninteresting performer, is not receptive to repeat performances.

			USE MAGIC DEVICE (CHA; TRAINED ONLY)

		</CHECK>
		<ACTION>
			None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.
		</ACTION>
		<TRYAGAIN>
			Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can't try to activate that item again for 24 hours.

		<SPECIAL>
			You cannot take 10 with this skill.
		</SPECIAL>
		<SYNERGY>
			If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.
		</SYNERGY>
		<DESCRIPTION>
			Activate Blindly: Some magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you're not and even if you don't know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you've activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can't activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but it doesn't do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.

			Decipher a Written Spell: This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.

			Emulate an Ability Score: To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you're emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don't need to make this check.

			Emulate an Alignment: Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user's alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.

			Emulate a Class Feature: Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20.  This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).

			Emulate a Race: Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.

			Use a Scroll: If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll's spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don't have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).

			Use a Wand: Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand's spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill also applies to other spell trigger magic items, such as staffs.

			Secure a Grappling Hook: Securing a grappling hook requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting weight. This check is made secretly, so that you don't know whether the rope will hold your weight.

			Bind a Character: When you bind another character with a rope, any Escape Artist check that the bound character makes is opposed by your Use Rope check.
