fix class special abilities(2d array per level)
ability entity?

will update saving feats to character as CharFeats (instead of FeatEntitys)

make it so only one instance of char wiz can be open at one time
^^ ditto for other wizards

add clear button to die window
//DONEdie window bug (load/save directory)? 

upload picture for character?
//DONE double click vs load for character load
changed languages from string to string[], character sheet crashes, save crashes? 
loading character closes home window, unable to return
^^ change to a composite, and overlay the charList

random character saving - cannot load? exception when loading items. null checking?
//DONE cannot delete characters with whitespace in names - need checking
//DONE cannot delete characters with illegal characters in name - need checking
connect character to fav die saving

manual character entering, character editing?

Random character name should be limited to 30 characters
^^ also, change to the top of the window, and bigger text box
