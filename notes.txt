will update saving feats to character as CharFeats (instead of FeatEntitys)

make it so only one instance of char wiz can be open at one time
^^ ditto for other wizards

Change the CharacterMain to a composite, and overlay the charList

random character saving - cannot load? exception when loading items. null checking?

//DONE, BUT NOT TESTED connect character to fav die saving
